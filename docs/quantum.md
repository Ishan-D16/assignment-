# Basics of Quantum Physics

Quantum physics explores the nature of matter and energy on atomic scales.

## Dual Nature of Light

Light behaves both as a particle and a wave — called wave-particle duality.

## Planck’s Equation

**E = hf**

Where:
- E = energy
- h = Planck’s constant
- f = frequency of light
