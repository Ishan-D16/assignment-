# Introduction to Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the study of energy, heat, and work. It lays the foundation of many engineering and natural processes.

## First Law

Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.

**ΔU = Q - W**

Where:
- ΔU = Change in internal energy
- Q = Heat added to the system
- W = Work done by the system

## Second Law

Entropy in an isolated system always increases over time.
